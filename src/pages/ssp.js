      <h1>Safe Space Polocy</h1>
      Code Network is and always will be a safe and inclusive space for
      everyone. We believe that in the absence of true equality in our world, we
      should aim to provide equity to those who need it.
      <div className="summary">
        <h3>tl;dr</h3>
        <p>
          Abuse, discrimination, harassment, assault, sexism, racism, ableism,
          religious persecution or homophobic behaviour of any kind is not
          tolerated in the Code Network community. This includes events,
          discussions and online communications. Any other behavior which would
          reasonably make a person feel trivialised or otherwise discriminated
          against is also prohibited. If you violate this policy you could be
          asked to leave our community either temporarily or permanently.s
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Abuse, discrimination, harassment and anything else mentioned above is
        not tolerated in this group. Anyone violating this policy may be asked
        to leave our community either temporarily or permanently. Please
        question in advance your capacity to deal with being asked to leave if
        necessary and how you would react in a progressive way if you were
        called out for behaviour in violation of this policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alcohol and other drugs are not an excuse for bad behaviour. We
        recognise the difficulties imposed by mental health and/or other
        disabilities, but these issues are not an excuse for poor behaviour
        either. Everyone can expect to be held accountable of their behaviour
        equally. We ask that you be aware of your capacity to remain in control
        of your emotions, actions and reactions when these things come into
        play.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you experience or witness any behaviour that crosses the boundaries,
        ideas or intentions in this policy, challenge them. If you act contrary
        to this policy, expect to be challenged. This means every time someone
        acts contrary to this policy, pull them up on it. Be polite but firm,
        and explain why their behaviour is not ok.

          We all take part in the Code Network community with a commitment to
          mutual respect, aid, anti-oppression advocacy, conflict resolution,
          non-violence and community building.
        </li>
        <li>
          We respect everyone’s names, preferred gender pronouns, expressed
          identities and experiences. We avoid making assumptions, promote
          mutual appreciation and understand that no one is required to share
          information about their identities or experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          We support the empowerment of each person and strive to continually
          acknowledge the histories and structures of oppression that
          marginalize some and divide us all.
        </li>
        <li>
          We commit to making our community as accessible as possible;
          physically, socially, and personally.
        </li>
        <li>We do not engage in violence or threats.</li>
        <li>
          We obtain explicit consent for physical contact or using others’
          belongings.
        </li>
        <li>
          We recognise that certain behaviour and language can act as a trigger
          for individuals, such as trivialising, joking about or dismissing
          someone’s thoughts or experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          We believe in stepping back and letting people and groups explain and
          conceive their own needs and requirements, and respect their choices
          and experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          We accept a shared responsibility where we hold ourselves and one
          another accountable to these agreements, without violence, judgment,
          or assumption of intent.
        </li>
        <li>
          We support the concept of freedom of speech, and aim to avoid all
          forms of censorship. However, we do not support freedom from
          consequence. Your free speech may incur consequences such as (but not
          limited to) moderation, being included in a dispute process, temporary
          or permanent exclusion from our community, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          We promote inclusive learning spaces. We encourage anyone who is
          feeling less than familiar with terminology, concepts or context to
          ask questions in the spirit of personal growth and learning.
